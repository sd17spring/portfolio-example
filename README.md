# About me

I am a second year student at [Olin College of Engineering](http://www.olin.edu/) studying software engineering. I am interested in making humans multi-planetary, enabling interstellar travel, developing personal AI better than JARVIS, and speculating about future Marvel cinematic universe. I have previously worked at Google, Facebook, Dropbox, SpaceX, and NASA JPL.

This website is where I put most up-to-date information about what I am doing, but you can check out my [Resume](#) and [LinkedIn Page](#).

# Projects

### Gene Finder 
#### [Source Code](#)
I wrote a script that performs *ab initio gene finding*, a process of detecting genes in arbitrary DNA sequences. I also wrote an interface connecting my program to an internet database of protein information called Protein BLAST.

### Computational Art
#### [Source Code](#)
I created a program that generates a random art based on recursive computation of elementary functions.

### Text Mining
#### [Source Code](#)
I created a program that automatically extracts a large number of tweets based on topics and runs a sentiment analysis to guage people's interest in the chosen topics.

### Interactive Visualization
#### [Source Code](#), [Project Website](#)
Working with 3 other students, I created a program that visually represents the population of cats in different states. My specific role in this project includes data collection through Google Cat Population API, data processing using Pandas, and designing interface between data collection script and visualization script.
